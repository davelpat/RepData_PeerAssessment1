## Loading and preprocessing the data

Read the data from the [fork of the course git repository][1]. The repository was originally forked from [Reproducable Research Coursera repository][2]. As the data are read in, the "date" and "interval" variables are combined to create a "date.timstamp" variable.

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("lubridate")

activity <- tbl_df(read.csv("activity.csv")) %>%
  mutate(date.timestamp = ymd_hm(sprintf("%10s %04d", date, interval)))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
